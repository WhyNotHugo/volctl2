# Volume Control

A simple Volume Control application, especially tailored for my Logitech MX Performance.
I like to use the side buttons (identified as m10 and m13) to control my volume.

This simple application handles this, as well as showing a notification with the current volume, and controls to mute all sound.

This application has close to zero flexibility, but the source might help as a reference to others (how to globally bind a mouse button using Xlib, proper pynotify action handling, etc).

Feel free to use this as a reference for anything you like.  The design isn't the best I've dont, but it's quite understandable, efficient, and works.
